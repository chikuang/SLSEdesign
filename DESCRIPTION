Authors@R: 
    c(person(given = "Chi-Kuang",
           family = "Yeh",
           role = c("aut", "cre"),
           email = "chi-kuang.yeh@uwaterloo.ca",

Description: With given input including number of points, design space, measure skewness, models and parameter value, this package calculates the objective value, probability measures and plot the equivalence theory for A- and D- optimal designs under the second-order least squares estimator.
