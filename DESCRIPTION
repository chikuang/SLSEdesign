Description: With given inputs that includes number of points, design space, measure skewness, models and parameter value, this package calculates the objective value, probability measures and plot the equivalence theory for A- and D- optimal designs under the second-order Least squares estimator. This package is based on the paper "Properties of optimal regression designs under the second-order least squares estimator" by Yeh and Zhou (2021).
