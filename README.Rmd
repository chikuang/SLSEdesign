## Description

This is a package to compute the optimal regression design under the second-order Least squares estimator 

## Installation

SLSEdesign is now available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/). Hence you may install it by typing

```r
install.packages("SLSEdesign")
```

or you may download the develop version by typing

```r
devtools::install_github("chikuang/SLSEdesign") # or pak::pkg_install("chikuang/SLSEdesign")
library(SLSEdesign)
```

## Details

Consider a general regression model,
$$y_i=\eta(\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{\theta})+ \epsilon_i, \quad i=1, \ldots, n,$$
where $y_i$ is the $i$-th observation of a response variable $y$ at design point
$\mathbf{x}_i \in S \subset \mathbb{R}^p$, $S$ is a design space,
$\mathbf{\theta} \in \mathbb{R}^q$ is the unknown regression parameter vector,
response function $\eta(\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{\theta})$   can be a linear or nonlinear
function of $\mathbf{\theta}$, and the errors $\epsilon_i$ are assumed to be uncorrelated with mean zero and finite variance $\sigma^2$.

Let $\hat{\mathbf{\theta}}$ be an estimator of $\mathbf{\theta}$, such as the least squares estimator. Various optimal designs are defined by minimizing $\phi \left( \mathbb{c}ov(\hat{\mathbf{\theta}}) \right)$
over the design points
$\mathbf{x}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{x}_n$, where function $\phi(\cdot)$  can be determinant, trace, or other scalar functions. The resulting designs are called optimal exact designs (OEDs), which depend on the response function $\eta(\cdot,\cdot)$, the design space $S$, the estimator $\hat{\mathbf{\theta}}$, the scalar function $\phi(\cdot)$, and the number of points $n$.

Second order least-squares estimator is defined as
```math
(\boldsymbol{\hat{\theta}}^\top,\hat{\sigma}^2)^\top:=\underset{\boldsymbol{\theta},\sigma^2}{\mathrm{argmin}}\sum_{i=1}^n \begin{pmatrix}
y_i-\eta(\boldsymbol{x}_i;\boldsymbol{\theta})\\
y_i^2-\eta^2(\boldsymbol{x}_i;\boldsymbol{\theta})-\sigma^2
\end{pmatrix}^\top W(\boldsymbol{x_i}) \begin{pmatrix}
y_i-\eta(\boldsymbol{x_i};\boldsymbol{\theta})\\
y_i^2-\eta^2(\boldsymbol{x_i};\boldsymbol{\theta})-\sigma^2
\end{pmatrix}.
```

### Comparison between ordinary least-squares and second order least-squares estimators

Note that $`W(\boldsymbol{x_i})`$ is a $`2\times 2`$ non-negative semi-definite matrix which may or may not depend on $\boldsymbol{x_i}$ (Wang and Leblanc, 2008). It is clear that SLSE is a natural extension of the OLSE which is defined based on the first-order difference function (i.e. $`y_i-\mathbb{E}[y_i]=y_i-\eta(\boldsymbol{x_i};\boldsymbol{\theta})`$). On the other hand, SLSE is defined using not only the first-order difference function, but also second-order difference function (i.e. $`y_i^2-\mathbb{E}[y_i^2]=y_i^2-(\eta^2(\boldsymbol{x_i};\boldsymbol{\theta})+\sigma^2))`$. One might think about the downsides of SLSE after discussing its advantages over OLSE. SLSE does have its disadvantages. It is not a linear estimator, and there is no closed-form solution. It requires more computational resources compared to OLSE due to its nonlinearity. However, numerical results can be easily computed for SLSE nowadays. As a result, SLSE is a powerful alternative estimator to be considered in research studies and real-life applications.

In particular, if we set the skewness parameter $t$ to be zero, the resulting optimal designs under SLSE and OLSE **will be the same**!

## Examples

#### D-optimal design of the 3rd order polynomial regression model

$$
y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \beta_2 x_i^2 + \beta_3 x_i^3 +\varepsilon_i
$$

A partial derivative of the mean function is required:

```r
poly3 <- function(xi,theta){
    matrix(c(1, xi, xi^2, xi^3), ncol = 1)
}
```

We first calculate the D-optimal design when the skewness parameter `t` is set to be zero. The resulting D-optimal design should be the same as the optimal design under the ordinary least-squares estimator.

```r
my_design <- Dopt(N = 31, u = seq(-1, 1, length.out = 31), 
     tt = 0, FUN = poly3, theta = rep(1, 4), num_iter = 500)
my_design$design
#    location    weight
# 1      -1.0 0.2615264
# 10     -0.4 0.2373288
# 22      0.4 0.2373288
# 31      1.0 0.2615264
my_design$val
# 5.133616
```

Now we look at the situation when the skewness parameter `t` is in the interval (0, 1], for instance, $0.7$.

```r
my_design <- Dopt(N = 31, u = seq(-1, 1, length.out = 31), 
     tt = 0.7, FUN = poly3, theta = rep(1, 4), num_iter = 500)
my_design$design
#    location    weight
# 1      -1.0 0.2714088
# 10     -0.4 0.2287621
# 22      0.4 0.2287621
# 31      1.0 0.2714088
my_design$val
# 6.27293
```

Add equivalence theorem plot for D-optimal design:

```r
design = data.frame(location = c(-1, -0.447, 0.447, 1),
 weight = rep(0.25, 4))
u = seq(-1, 1, length.out = 201)
plot_direction_Dopt(u, design, tt=0, FUN = poly3,
  theta = rep(0, 4))
```

#### D-optimal design of the 3rd order polynomial regression model without intercept

$$
y_i = \beta_1 x_i + \beta_2 x_i^2 + \beta_3 x_i^3 +\varepsilon_i
$$

In the last example, the support points did not change as `t` increases. However, it is not always the case, and. the optimal design may be depending on `t`. 

```r
poly3_no_intercept <- function(xi, theta){
    matrix(c(xi, xi^2, xi^3), ncol = 1)
}
my_design <- Dopt(N = 31, u = seq(-1, 1, length.out = 31), 
     tt = 0, FUN = poly3_no_intercept, theta = rep(1, 3), num_iter = 500)
my_design$design
#    location    weight
# 1      -1.0 0.3275005
# 7      -0.6 0.1565560
# 25      0.6 0.1565560
# 31      1.0 0.3275005
my_design$val
# 3.651524

my_design <- Dopt(N = 31, u = seq(-1, 1, length.out = 31), 
     tt = 0.9, FUN = poly3_no_intercept, theta = rep(1, 3), num_iter = 500)
my_design$design
#    location    weight
# 1      -1.0 0.2888423
# 10     -0.4 0.2096781
# 22      0.4 0.2096781
# 31      1.0 0.2888423
my_design$val
# 4.892601
```

## TODO
+ [x] Version update for the develop version
+ [x] Improve the computational speed by vectorizing the code, and remove loops
+ [x] Remove the unnecessary dependence: tibble, gridExtra, graphics and stats
+ [ ] Add c-optimality criterion
+ [ ] Python and Julia version of the package, which are expected to be faster than in R
+ [ ] Merge the functions that compute the directional derivatives. Maybe adding an extra argument to indicate the design criterion used.
